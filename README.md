# An Introduction to the NCBI and BLAST

This module is a short introduction to the [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) - or "NCBI" for short - and an overview of the various tools available there to the public. Of these tools, we will focus mostly on BLAST - the Basic Local Alignment Search Toool. 

An outline for the module is below:

  * [What is the NCBI?](#What-is-the-NCBI?)
  * What is BLAST?
  * How does BLAST work?
  * For what purposes would you use BLAST?
  * Let's BLAST something!
    * Example One: Find a transgene in the Papaya Genome.
    * Example Two: Finding novel sequences 
  * Designing and Validating Primers with BLAST

## What is the NCBI? 

The [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is an important component of the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov) that has two broadly defined functions. First, the NCBI is tasked with hosting and maintaining a series of databases relevant to biotechnology and biomedicine. Secondly, the NCBI also serves to both curate and develop a wide variety of bioinformatics tools and services for researchers to use. We will take a better look at these two functions below. For further reading, a good overview of the history of the NCBI can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK148949/).

### NCBI Databases

 >Understanding nature's mute but elegant language of living cells is the quest of modern molecular biology. From an alphabet of only four letters representing the chemical subunits of DNA emerges a syntax of life processes whose most complex expression is man. The unraveling and use of this "alphabet" to form new "words and phrases" is a central focus of the field of molecular biology. The staggering volume of molecular data and its cryptic and subtle patterns have led to an absolute requirement for computerized databases and analysis tools. - *from the NCBI mission statement*

With the rapid expansion of the *availability* of biological data in the Twentieth Century came the need for tools and software to both structure and query this data. This need brought together computer scientists, biologists, and government officials to help design and launch a variety of databases and protocols to assist researchers in both curating new knowledge and validating the old. For further reading, an interesting overview of the general history of bioinformatics (as related to computational structures) can be found [here](http://web.bf.uni-lj.si/bi/biokemija/bioinfo/2007/Material/Uvod1.pdf). 

Though there are many different databases avialable for users, Some of the more well-known databases at the NCBI include:

  * [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/): An annotated collection of all publically available nucloetide sequences and their protein translations. 
  * [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed): A search engine for accessing a variety of research publications (and their associated data) on life sciences and biomedical topics.
  * [Sequence Read Archive](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?): Also known as the "Short Read Acrhive", the SRA is a bioinformatics database that provides a repository for sequencing data generated by next-generation, high-throuput sequencing - such as data generated for [RNA-Seq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2949280/) or [ChIP-seq](http://bitesizebio.com/13541/an-introduction-to-chip-seq/) experiments. 

A full list of the available resources and tools may be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/all/).

These databases are all linked by the [Entrez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrez) search engine. Entrez allows users to search many different discrete databases at the same time. For example: if we search the string "cftr" (a gene responsible for encoding a protein important to the pathology of cystic fibrosis in *Homo sapiens*):
