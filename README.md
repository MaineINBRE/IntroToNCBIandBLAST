# An Introduction to the NCBI and BLAST

This module is a short introduction to the [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) - or "NCBI" for short - and an overview of the various tools available there to the public. Of these tools, we will focus mostly on BLAST - the Basic Local Alignment Search Toool. 

An outline for the module is below:

  * [What is the NCBI?](#What-is-the-NCBI?)
  * What is BLAST?
  * How does BLAST work?
  * For what purposes would you use BLAST?
  * Let's BLAST something!
    * Example One: Find a transgene in the Papaya Genome.
    * Example Two: Finding novel sequences 
  * Designing and Validating Primers with BLAST

## What is the NCBI? 

The [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is an important component of the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov) specifically tasked with maintaining a series of databases relevant to biotechnology and biomedicine. It is also an important resource for the curation and development of wide variety of bioinformatics tools and services. Some of the more well-known databases include:

  * [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/): An annotated collection of all publically available nucloetide sequences and their protein translations. 
  * [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed): A search engine for accessing a variety of research publications (and their associated data) on life sciences and biomedical topics.
  * [Sequence Read Archive](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?): Also known as the "Short Read Acrhive", the SRA is a bioinformatics database that provides a repository for sequencing data generated by next-generation, high-throuput sequencing - such as data generated for [RNA-Seq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2949280/) or [ChIP-seq](http://bitesizebio.com/13541/an-introduction-to-chip-seq/) experiments.
