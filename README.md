This module is a short introduction to the [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) - or "NCBI" for short - and an overview of the various tools available there to the public. Of these tools, we will focus mostly on BLAST - the Basic Local Alignment Search Toool. 

An outline for the module is below:

  * What is the NCBI?[#What-is-the-NCBI?]

  * How does BLAST work?
  * For what purposes would you use BLAST?
  * Let's BLAST something!
    * Example One: Find a transgene in the Papaya Genome.
    * Example Two: Finding novel sequences 
  * Designing and Validating Primers with BLAST
